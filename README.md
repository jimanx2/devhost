Actually I just got a development laptop (migrated from Apple macbook pro because of... you know -- reasons), and my nature of work needs
me to develop on unix environments (Ruby-on-Rails, Python, nodejs et cetera et cetera) and I already know that i can use VM to do that.
But i'd hate to have the VM running on foreground. Thus, I merged some ready-made tools (not by me, i just make the VM) into a package that
everyone can use without much hassle.

# drawback

This is not a stable release. I need help from you to report to me if it does not work for you. Well, thank you in advance for that.
